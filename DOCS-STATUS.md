# Documentation status

What each plugin's documentation was last checked against, so a review can start from the last
verified commit instead of from the whole history.

**Reviewed through** is the newest source commit the docs are known to describe. Everything after it
in that repository is undocumented until somebody says otherwise.

Sources live in `~/Java/Exylia/<repo>`; override with `EXYLIA_SOURCES`.

| Docs | Repository | Version documented | Reviewed through | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exyliaarmorskin` | `ExyliaArmorSkin` | 1.0.0 | `c608783` 2026-09-03 | Current — wardrobe, per-piece permissions, twenty animated skins, the four body-aware animation types and the trim-metal cycle. |
| `exyliaarmortrims` | `ExyliaArmorTrims` | 1.1.0 | `1d83e8f` 2026-09-03 | Current — the cosmetic gate is a library contract, documented in the library’s Cosmetic rules page rather than per plugin. |
| `exyliaarrows` | `ExyliaArrows` | 1.0.5 | `2a7335b` 2026-09-03 | Current — rewritten for the 120 display-driven effects, the three triggers, tokens, the menu and the `arrows-effects` flag. |
| `exyliacapture` | `ExyliaCapture` | 1.1.0 | `c8c2ec7` 2026-09-02 | Current — typed durations noted. The database indexes and the admin menu layout were not worth a page. |
| `exyliachatcosmetics` | `ExyliaChatCosmetics` | 1.0.0 | `e1bf009` 2026-09-07 | Current — first full documentation: the shipped catalogue (180 tags in seven tabs, 90 nick, 96 chat, 90 shadow and 77 rank colours, 18 fonts, 5 modifiers, 18 animations), tag marks as sprites, particles and head skins with the 1.21.9 ceiling, the four custom kinds and the create/edit token economy, entitlements and expiry, the menus, and the whole built-in chat module across five pages, mentions included: a name is a mention with or without the `@`, and the nudge ships as a sound alone. Written against the source: the repository's own `docs/` predates the current catalogue by twelve commits. |
| `exyliaclans` | `ExyliaClans` | 1.1.0 | `7d014e2` 2026-09-08 | Current — reviewed for 1.1.0. `visibility-mode` now ships as `DISABLED` and has five values; the kick truce, the cross-server clan home, the 32-character role-name clean, the level-table bounds and the configurable `placeholders.na` / `placeholders.none` fallbacks are documented. Corrected against the source: the DTR regeneration arithmetic, `setdtr` having no lower clamp and clearing the freeze, the backfill running on every start, an expired regroup point still teleporting whoever is counting down, `pillar-duration-seconds` and the camp `duration-seconds` being inert, the sneak-any-click claim confirm, the camelCase columns, and SQLite never having been a backend. The standalone reflection jar is named on the API page. |
| `exyliaclasses` | `ExyliaClasses` | 1.0.0 | `d48bfe0` 2026-08-31 | Current — the only change since was a database index. |
| `exyliaevents` | `ExyliaEvents` | 1.2.0 | `3c6b6aa` 2026-09-02 | 49 types, gauntlets, the 33 Mace Roulette modifiers, PvP during the hunt, the shrinking floor and event chat isolation. The 1.3.0 statistics and leaderboard placeholders are documented ahead of the rest (`fb7782d`). **Gap:** everything else in 1.3.0 — the team King of the Hill event, one dodgeball ball per player, hidden names in Hide & Seek, the TNT Run block break, 15 more trivia questions and the move of player-facing text into `messages.yml`. |
| `exyliaffa` | `ExyliaFFA` | 1.1.1 | `569a4f1` 2026-09-02 | Current — arena chat isolation and duration inputs documented. |
| `exyliahiteffect` | `ExyliaHitEffect` | 1.0.10 | `1fe222a` 2026-09-03 | Current. |
| `exyliakilleffect` | `ExyliaKillEffect` | 1.3.0 | `1dd9f79` 2026-09-08 | Current — the 183 effects in seven categories, the Ragdoll category and the `[RAGDOLL]` step 161 of them are built on, `crate.reward` (`UNLOCK`/`ITEM`/`BOTH`) in place of `give-token`, the per-reel win and duplicate effects, and the preview stage taking only the position. |
| `exylialib` | `ExyliaLib` | 1.128.0 | `4325202` 2026-09-08 | Current — chat rules, cosmetic rules, the display ceiling, region flags, log cleanup, the extra NPC motion, the ragdoll module (a body cut into its six parts, in eleven poses), and the pending-reward store the library keeps with `claimOnJoin`. |
| `exyliapractice` | `ExyliaPracticeCore` | 1.0.0 | `a8b3bf6` 2026-09-03 | Arena usages, the short `practice` identifier, `total_bot_players` and typed kit-rule durations documented. **Gap:** the Bot PvP module has no page at all — difficulties, its menus and `bot-name`/`bot-skin` are undocumented. |
| `exyliapracticebot` | `ExyliaPracticeBotV3` | 1.2.2 | `20ca313` 2026-09-06 | Current — first full documentation: the seven combat models and their per-mode config, the five-rung skill ladder, the gear and buffs a player tunes, both menu files and the eleven `practicebot` actions, attack/follow and the three automatic removals, `max-bots` against the slider bounds, and the API. Written against the source, not the config comments: two of those are stale (see below). |
| `exyliasandbox` | `ExyliaSandBox` | 1.0.3 | `7e6b005` 2026-09-06 | Current — first full documentation, eighteen pages: the generated worlds and their five terrain presets, the RTP and its 1v1 queue matcher, kits and the permission tier that counts down from 100, the kit room, the teleport pads, the admin panel, the nineteen menus, the seven tables and `SandBoxService`. Two things are documented as broken rather than as promised: the kit-room category editor never writes back, and finishing a pre-generation shuts the server down. |
| `exyliashields` | `ExyliaShields` | 1.0.4 | `83a54f9` 2026-09-01 | Current — the only change since was a database index. |
| `exyliastaff` | `ExyliaStaff` | 1.3.1 | `5434a74` 2026-09-08 | Current — reviewed for 1.3.0. Four module pages added: inventory restore (causes, retention, the five screens, the eleven parts and the offline queue), reveal, AFK and the action bar. The staff armour is no longer really worn: it is stated to the players around the wearer as an overlay, corrected on **Staff mode** and **First steps**. Left out on purpose: global chat, which is one hotbar button and three modes, and the scoreboard, documented inside **Staff mode**. |
| `exyliasurvivalcore` | `ExyliaSurvivalCore` | 1.1.2 | `0a08aea` 2026-09-08 | Current — first full documentation, sixteen pages added to the three that existed. The thirty-two modules grouped into eight pages, the fifty-eight menus and which folder survives a reload, the thirty-one tables, the commands, the generated files and the crates module in full. Written against the source, not the config comments: four of those are stale and are documented as such (see below). The permissions and placeholders pages were corrected for the crates and player-settings nodes and for the stat ids. |
| `exyliatotemtrainer` | `ExyliaTotemTrainer` | 1.0.0 | `6ec68a0` 2026-09-04 | Current — first full documentation: the six shipped modes as four choices, grading and score, duels with draws and the even-format rule, arenas from the admin menu, per-mode leaderboards, the `totem_` PlaceholderAPI spelling. Blackout and `close-inventory` documented. |

## The API pages

Every plugin's **API** page was rewritten on 2026-09-06 for the new API system, and they are current
for the whole suite regardless of what each row above says. A row's *reviewed through* still refers
to the rest of that plugin's set, not to its API page.

What changed: the per-plugin reflection jars and static facades are gone. There is now one published
artifact, `com.github.DiGround-s.ExyliaLib:exylia-api`, holding every service, record, enum and event
in the suite, reached through `net.exylia.lib.api.ExyliaAPI`. Documented against `exylia-api` at
ExyliaLib `befa514` — release tag `v1.113.0`, the tag JitPack builds and the one the pages name.

| | |
|---|---|
| Hub page | `exylialib` — integration for Gradle, Gradle Kotlin DSL and Maven, the lookup, timing, events, and the classloader reason the artifact must be `compileOnly`. New page. |
| Rewritten | The 14 plugins that already had an API page. |
| New | `exyliasurvivalcore`, which had none and now publishes 31 methods and 6 cancellable events. Registered in `SURVIVALCORE_NAV`. |
| Added later | `exyliachatcosmetics` (`CosmeticsService` and `ChatService`) and `PracticeBotService`, which the artifact already published but the hub table had not listed. |
| Added later | `exyliasandbox` (`SandBoxService`), once that plugin's set was written. |
| Not documented | ExyliaBetCore, ExyliaSpecialsV3, ExyliaPearls and ExyliaTotems all publish a service, but have no documentation set on this site at all. They are absent from the hub's service table for that reason. |

The source of truth for these pages is
`~/Java/Exylia/ExyliaLib/exylia-api/src/main/java/net/exylia/lib/api/`, not the plugin repositories:
the interfaces carry the javadoc that says why each method behaves as it does.

### Two stale strings in ExyliaPracticeBotV3

Found while writing this set and documented as behaviour rather than as promised. Both claim that
picking a combat mode applies that mode's kit. It does not: `Loadout.of(mode).applyTo(settings)` runs
only from the `BotSettings` constructor — first creation and `/bot reset` — and from
`PracticeBotServiceImpl` on an API spawn. `set_mode` and `cycle mode` call `setMode` and nothing else,
which is the intended behaviour: `Loadout`'s javadoc and the menu item's own lore both say the kit
stays as the player left it.

- `MessagesDefaults` default for `bot.mode-changed`: *"Mode set to %mode% » kit applied."*
- `BotDefaults`' `@Comment` on `bot.mode`: *"Picking a mode applies that mode's kit AND its combat model."*

The pages describe what the code does. If the strings are corrected, nothing here needs rewriting.

### Fields ExyliaChatCosmetics declares and does not use

Found while writing that set. Each is read from the file without complaint and reaches the definition;
nothing then consumes it. The pages say so rather than describing an effect that does not happen.

- `requirement` on any cosmetic entry: parsed by `CosmeticInfo.read` and copied through
  `RankColorType.withoutPermission`, never evaluated. `BrowserRows` filters on `hidden()` alone.
- `safe` on a font: reports whether the glyphs live in the basic plane. No menu value exposes it and
  nothing restricts a font by it.
- `animation` on a custom cosmetic: the column exists and both renderers honour it, but every caller
  of `create` and `edit` passes `null`, so nothing writes one.

Its own `docs/` folder is a version behind the plugin — it was last touched at `e6d264b`, twelve
commits before `4e4428b`, and its tags, fonts, menu-default and command sections all predate what
ships. The site's pages were written from the source; the repository's notes were used only where the
source confirmed them.

## How a review goes

1. `scripts/doc-drift.sh` — see what moved.
2. Read the source for what it names, never the commit message alone.
3. Update both languages of the affected pages, and `src/content/registry.ts` when the version,
   tagline, summary or navigation changes.
4. `pnpm build`, then check the generated `out/` for broken links and anchors.
5. Move the row's **reviewed through** to the repository's `HEAD` and note what is left.

## What is deliberately left out

Not every commit is documentation. Database indexes, refactors, internal fixes and packet-level
performance work change nothing a server owner reads or writes, and a page that lists them is a page
nobody trusts. What earns a change: a new file, key, command, permission or placeholder; a default
that moved; a rule a player can feel; a limit an owner can hit.

## Conventions worth keeping

- Every English page has a Spanish twin with a translated slug, registered in `src/content/registry.ts`.
- Nothing goes in the documentation that was not read in the source. Commit messages describe
  intent; the code describes behaviour.
- Placeholder tables list the whole placeholder, not just its tail: every name is written complete,
  with its `%` signs and its full prefix, and each one gets its own row and its own description. Never
  a bare suffix, never two names sharing a row, never a group standing in for the placeholders under it.
- One identifier per plugin, and it is the long one. Several plugins publish a second, shorter
  PlaceholderAPI identifier through `Placeholders.identifier(...)` — `ecc`, `practice`, `exyliatotem`.
  They keep working; the documentation does not mention them. A plugin whose registered names carry a
  short group prefix (`staff_`, `totem_`, `classes_`) is a different case: the reference page writes the
  PlaceholderAPI form, and the pages that document that plugin's own YAML keep the registered name and
  say once why the two differ.

### What ExyliaSandBox does that the docs call out rather than promise

Both are behaviour, not roadmap. The pages describe what the code does.

- **The kit-room category editor never saves.** The grid opens, accepts drops and closes; the listener
  that would write it back is written but never registered, so every change is discarded. The pages
  point owners at **Reset to Defaults** instead.
- **Finishing a pre-generation shuts the server down.** `Bukkit.shutdown()` is called when the queue
  drains, with the log line *"All worlds pregenereted. Restarting server..."*. Intended for the first
  boot; it fires the same way when a world is created from the panel on a live server.

Smaller ones, all documented in place: `disable_powder_snow` is toggled and read but never persisted;
`heightVariation` and `stoneVariants` are stored and never read; the three `kit-creator.*-input-title`
blocks in `config.yml` are orphaned; `back.outside-world` and `queue.select-kit` are never sent;
deleting a teleport pad or a kit-room category asks for no confirmation; and the five seeded kit-room
categories are still Spanish.

### Four stale comments in ExyliaSurvivalCore

The generated files disagree with the code in four places. The documentation follows the code and says
so on the page where it matters.

- **All thirty-six `menus/admin/*.yml` claim to be the owner's.** Every one opens with *"This file is
  yours to edit… written once, when it is missing, and never overwritten"*, and the whole directory is
  deleted and re-extracted from the jar on every enable **and every `/sc reload`**. The header is
  correct only in the twenty-two menus under `modules/*/menus/`. The one editable admin screen is
  `modules/warps/menus/warp_setup.yml`, which lives outside that directory.
- **`ranks.yml`'s header lists requirement types `kills` and `level`.** Neither exists. The real set is
  `money`, `playtime`, `placeholder` and `permission`; anything else is dropped silently, leaving the
  rank free.
- **`messages.yml` → `admin.usage`** names `delhome` and `listhomes` as `/survivalcore` subcommands.
  They are on `/homesadmin`; `/survivalcore` has only `reload`.
- **Eight defaults are still in Spanish** despite the commit that translated the rest: the warmup
  action bars and titles for spawn, homes, back, TPA and RTP.

### Things ExyliaSurvivalCore does not do, documented as such

- `/stats` is **never registered** — the command method is missing its annotation, so the server never
  receives it and both `stats` nodes are unreachable. The screens open from `survivalcore:stats_open`.
- `/bounty cancel` opens the list `/bounty` opens and cancels nothing.
- `exyliasurvivalcore.bounties.anonymous` is inert: the shipped `bounty_place_confirm.yml` hard-codes
  the anonymous argument to `false`.
- `/spawn`, `/reclaim` and `/playtime` check no permission, and the last two write.
- There is no bare `/afkzone` and no bare `/repair`; `/powerupsadmin` is silent when its module is off;
  `/autotpaaccept` duplicates `/tpatoggle autoaccept`.
- `spawner_import_from_chest` and `lc_import_from_chest` are complete and unreachable — no shipped menu
  binds either.
